            <h2>Service Overview</h2>
            <p>Our services are organised into six core categories addressing the full spectrum of business technology requirements. Each service category is supported by detailed service agreements, clearly defined scope and limitations, and documented support procedures.

                <p>Managed IT support represents our core service offering, providing ongoing technology infrastructure monitoring, helpdesk support, systems administration, and proactive maintenance services.

Issues are categorised by severity: Critical issues affecting business operations receive immediate response, High priority issues affecting individual users receive response within 2 hours during business hours, Medium priority issues receive response within 4 hours, and Low priority requests receive response within 2 business days.</p>
                <p>All support interactions are documented in ticketing systems providing clients with visibility into issue status, resolution steps, and service history. Monthly service reports summarise support activities, performance metrics, and any recommendations for process improvements or system enhancements.</p>

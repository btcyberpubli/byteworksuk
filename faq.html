A detailed description of all services is available on our Services page. We tailor service offerings to match individual client requirements rather than imposing standardised solutions.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-card">
                    <h3>Who are typical ByteWorks UK clients?</h3>
                    <p>ByteWorks UK works primarily with small and medium-sized enterprises across the United Kingdom.

                <div class="faq-card">
                    <h3>Do you offer support for specific software or systems?</h3>
                    <p>ByteWorks UK provides support for a wide range of business systems and applications. Specific software support is documented in individual service agreements. Where software support is not included in standard managed services, support is available on a project or time-and-materials basis. Please contact us to discuss support for specific applications.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-card">
                    <h3>What is the difference between managed support and project-based services?</h3>
                    <p>Managed support involves ongoing technology support on a monthly contract basis with defined service levels and regular reporting. Project-based services address specific technology initiatives with defined scope and completion criteria. Many clients use combinations of both engagement models depending on requirements. We provide proposals detailing each approach and associated costs.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-card">
                    <h3>Can ByteWorks UK work with my existing IT provider?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, ByteWorks UK can complement existing IT arrangements by providing additional expertise, capacity, or specialised services. We work collaboratively with other IT providers where appropriate. Please contact us to discuss how we can support your current technology environment.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-card">
                    <h3>How long does it take to implement services?</h3>
                    <p>Implementation timelines vary based on service scope and complexity. Simple services such as helpdesk support may commence within days. Complex infrastructure projects may require weeks of planning and implementation. We provide detailed project timelines in service proposals and maintain regular communication regarding progress.</p>

                <h2>Pricing and Billing</h2>

                <div class="faq-card">
                    <h3>How is ByteWorks UK pricing structured?</h3>
                    <p>Pricing depends on service type and scope. Managed support services typically use monthly pricing with tiered levels based on user count and service scope. Project-based services use estimated hours and resource requirements. We provide transparent quotes before commencing work, and costs are broken down clearly on invoices. Custom pricing is available for large organisations or long-term partnerships.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-card">
                    <h3>How are invoices calculated?</h3>
                    <p>Managed support invoices are based on the contracted service tier and number of users supported. Project invoices are calculated using hourly rates multiplied by estimated or actual hours plus any material costs. All calculations are itemised on invoices for transparency. We are happy to explain any invoice line items upon request.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-card">
                    <h3>What payment methods do you accept?</h3>
                    <p>ByteWorks UK accepts payment by bank transfer, credit/debit cards, and cheques. Preferred payment method is bank transfer. For regular clients, standing order arrangements can be established. Please contact us to discuss payment options.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-card">
                    <h3>What are your payment terms?</h3>
                    <p>Standard payment terms are 30 days from invoice date. This means invoices are due within 30 days of being issued. For new clients or large contracts, shorter payment terms may apply. Specific payment terms are stated in service agreements and invoices.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-card">
                    <h3>What happens if I don't pay an invoice on time?</h3>
                    <p>Late payment is subject to interest at 8% per annum plus Bank of England base rate under the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998. Services may be suspended for accounts with significantly overdue invoices. We contact clients regarding payment issues to work toward resolution. Persistent non-payment may result in legal action to recover amounts owed.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-card">

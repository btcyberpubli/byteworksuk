The Company is not subject to independent dispute resolution schemes or ombudsman procedures.</p>

            <h2>13. Complaints Procedure</h2>
            <p>Clients may lodge complaints regarding service delivery by contacting the Company at <span id="email-display"></span> or <span id="phone-display"></span>. Written complaints should clearly describe the complaint, relevant dates, and desired resolution.</p>

            <h3>Complaint Investigation</h3>
            <p>The Company will acknowledge complaint receipt within 2 business days. Complaints will be investigated promptly and a substantive response provided within 10 business days of complaint receipt. Where investigation requires extended time, interim updates will be provided. Complaint resolution may include service corrections, partial refunds, or other remedies at the Company's discretion.</p>

            <h3>Escalation</h3>
            <p>If you are dissatisfied with the initial complaint response, you may escalate to the Company's management team at <span id="email-display-2"></span>. Management will conduct a full review and provide a final response within 15 business days.</p>

            <h2>14. Third-Party Links and Content</h2>
            <p>This website includes links to third-party websites. The Company does not endorse third-party content and is not responsible for third-party content, accuracy, availability, or compliance with law. Third-party websites are governed by their terms and conditions. Use of third-party websites is at your sole risk.</p>

            <h2>15. Termination of Services</h2>

            <h3>Termination by the Company</h3>
            <p>The Company may terminate services immediately where clients violate these terms, fail to pay invoices, or engage in unlawful conduct. The Company may terminate services with 30 days' notice for other reasons. Termination does not release clients from payment obligations for services rendered.</p>

            <h3>Termination by Clients</h3>
            <p>Clients may terminate services according to terms specified in service agreements. Termination notices should be provided in writing to the Company. Upon termination, clients remain liable for payment of services rendered through the termination date.</p>

            <h3>Post-Termination Obligations</h3>
            <p>Upon service termination, the Company will return client data in agreed formats and cease service delivery. Confidentiality obligations survive termination indefinitely. Payment obligations for invoiced services survive termination.</p>

            <h2>16. Data Backup and Disaster Recovery</h2>
            <p>Where the Company provides data backup services, backups are created according to agreed schedules. The Company makes reasonable efforts to ensure backup integrity but does not guarantee zero data loss or specific recovery time objectives. Clients remain responsible for maintaining independent backup systems.</p>

            <h2>17. Security and Acceptable Use</h2>
            <p>Clients are responsible for maintaining appropriate security of their systems and credentials. The Company is not responsible for unauthorised access resulting from client security breaches or negligence. Clients agree not to engage in activities that compromise system security or expose the Company to legal liability including attempting to breach security systems, introducing malicious code, or engaging in illegal activity through the Company's systems.</p>

            <h2>18. Entire Agreement</h2>
            <p>These Terms and Conditions constitute the entire agreement between the Company and users regarding website use and services. All prior agreements, understandings, and negotiations are superseded. No modification is valid unless made in writing and signed by both parties. If any provision is found unenforceable, remaining provisions continue in effect.</p>

            <h2>19. Severability</h2>
            <p>If any provision of these Terms and Conditions is found to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision shall be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable, or if not possible, severed. Remaining provisions continue in full force and effect.</p>
